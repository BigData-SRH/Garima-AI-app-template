This is a **template Streamlit app** for teaching and small projects.

You can adapt it by:

1. Renaming the project in `README.md` and `app.py`
2. Replacing `data/example.csv` with your own data
3. Editing the page files in the `pages/` folder
4. Adding more dependencies to `requirements.txt` if needed
